            <div class="projectText">Hell’s Chicken is a 2.5D video game developed in Unity for Windows. The goal was to
                create an easy-to-use game with an ironic character. In the making of Hell’s Chicken the main focus
                points were placed on the creation of captivating-looking environments that would allow gameplay with
                intuitive mechanics. The 3D environments and game characters were created, rigged and animated with
                Blender. Here is the plot of the game: “There was once an angel, the brightest of his kind, whose name
                was Lucifer. Full of arrogance, he rebelled against God, but was thrown into Hell for having tried to
                defy the Creator. In his fall, he saw an unlucky chicken, which he knew would be his only chance to
                escape damnation unnoticed. He then grabbed onto it and dragged it to the depths of Hell, where he
                possessed its body and gave it his powers. Will Lucifer be able to make it back to Heaven and overthrow
                the Ruler?”</div>
